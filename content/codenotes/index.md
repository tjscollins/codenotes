Welcome to *codenotes Blog*, my Computer Science and Software Development blog.  Why fill the internet with even more content about object-oriented design, algorithm design, and web frameworks?  Well, simply put, my motives are selfish. *codenotes* is more for me than it is for you (though I suspect that applies to most blogs).

## Who am I?

I'm just some web developer.
