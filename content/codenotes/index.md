Welcome to *codenotes*, my Computer Science and Software Development blog, where I try to explain by example the connections between Computer Science concepts and Web Development practice.

## Who am I?

My name is Tyler Collins.  I'm just some web developer.  Before that, I was a high school teacher.  I learned web development in my spare time, spending many hours studying scripting languages, APIs, design patterns, programming paradigms, algorithms, and a whole host of other topics.  One of the things I found was that existing instructional material tended to take on one of two forms: overly theoretical textbook-style material, and overly practical how-to or tutorial material.  What was often missing was material that drew clear, numerous connections between the two--material that I would consider essential to mastering any discipline, not just software development.

## What is codenotes?

*codenotes* is an attempt to give back to the community of self-taught developers who enabled me to eventually make a career in software development.  Each post takes a topic in Computer Science or Software Engineering and tries to explain it in a way that (I hope) will be practical and useful to developers trying to understand how the concept matters in their work.  I'm hoping to bridge the gap between textbook material and tutorial material that sometimes makes it hard to see why studying the theory behind things like trees or type systems is useful in the practical daily work of software development and especially web development.  Hopefully you find something useful to you here.  You can browse the posts by topic on the left, or search through posts by title and keyword.
