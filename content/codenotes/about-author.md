I'm a full-stack web developer living on the Big Island of Hawaii with my wife Ria and our corgi Ein.  I spent six years working as a public school teacher on the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands before learning web development and changing careers.  If you're looking to hire a developer with experience in designing user interfaces with ReactJS, developing backend server applications in Clojure and NodeJs, and working with SQL and MongoDB backends for remote work, take a look at my [resume](/about/resume).  You can reach me at [tjscollins@gmail.com](mailto:tjscollins@gmail.com).
